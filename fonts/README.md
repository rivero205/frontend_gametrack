Place the TT Autonomus font files here to host them locally.

Expected filenames (examples):
- TTAutonomus-Regular.woff2
- TTAutonomus-Regular.woff
- TTAutonomus-Bold.woff2
- TTAutonomus-Bold.woff

Steps:
1. Obtain the licensed font files for "TT Autonomus" (woff/woff2 preferably).
2. Copy them into this folder (`public/fonts/`).
3. They will be automatically available at `/fonts/TTAutonomus-*.woff2`.

If you want me to add font files to the repo, upload them here or provide them and I will add them for you.
